# Annual_Report

Designed and developed a reporting portal using Power BI to present student performance data.
Created 5 interactive dashboards for different departments: Computer Engineering, Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and General Science.
Each dashboard included important information such as student CGPA, attendance, and other academic records.
Made the dashboards easy to understand so that teachers and administration could quickly check student progress.
Helped the institute in preparing annual reports and making better academic decisions through clear data visualization.
